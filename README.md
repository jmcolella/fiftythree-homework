Homework assignment for FiftyThree Software Engineer position

# Part 1 - Thinking
- run command `node duplicate.js` to see output for algorithim

# Part 2 - Visual
- navigate to `modal-challenge` directory
- run command `npm install`
- run command `npm run start` and page will open in your default browser

# Additional Notes
- For creating the modal, I found some quick CSS through W3 and imported that into the application.
- If I had more time:
    - I would devise a better solution for handling different messages for each modal. Each message is passed as an argument into a function, but that gets a bit unwieldly if there are a bunch of modals with a lot of text for each. 
    - I would have consolidated all of the buttons into one reusable component since they all have pratically the same functionality.
    - I would have liked to incorporarte tests for both parts but I didn't have enough time to write them.
